GAP netï¼šauto-decoder

This framework focuses on two perspectives that would allow GAPNet to learn effective priors: 1) To achieve high-quality, we introduce a 3DGS- based head representation boosted with part-based and dy- namic modeling. 2) For enhancing generalizability, we de- sign GAPNet in an auto-decoder manner, which constructs continuous part-based identity spaces that can serve as pow- erful generative priors to guide the few-shot creation. Ad- ditionally, we leverage mesh tracking priors by predicting Gaussian attributes relative to the tracked mesh [54].
