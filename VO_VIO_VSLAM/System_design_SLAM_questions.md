    * As the driver moves, the app detects visual markers or Bluetooth beacons.
    * The app sends the detected IDs to the server.
    * The server triangulates or otherwise determines the vehicle's position based on the detected infrastructure.
    * The app displays the vehicle's location on the garage map and can highlight available parking spots (if integrated with a parking availability system).

This helps to reduce drift and maintain global consistency.
    * **Localization:** To localize within the built map, the system continuously performs VIO and also detects and matches visual markers. The marker detections provide absolute pose corrections. If markers are not visible, the system relies on the VIO and the existing map.

**Workflow:**

* The robot initially explores the parking garage, performing VIO and building a 3D map.
* As visual markers are detected, their 3D locations are estimated relative to the local map.
* If the marker's absolute location is known (from a prior survey or a continuously refined global map), this information is used to correct the robot's pose and the map.
* For localization, the robot uses the built map and continuously matches observed features and detects markers to estimate its current pose.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Marker Placement:** Strategic placement of markers is important for observability and accurate global localization.
* **Robust VIO:** The VIO system needs to be robust to the challenging conditions of a parking garage (lighting, repetitive structures).
* **Map Fusion (if multiple robots are used):** If multiple robots contribute to the map, a mechanism for map merging and alignment is needed.
* **Dynamic Objects:** The system should be able to handle moving cars and people to some extent.

3.  **HD-Map Storage and Management:**
    * **Scalable Database:** Store the large-scale HD-map in an efficient and queryable database format.
    * **Versioning and Change Management:** Track changes to the map over time and maintain different versions.
    * **Data Access API:** Provide an API for autonomous vehicles and other users to access the HD-map data.

4.  **Calibration and Quality Assurance:**
    * **Automated Calibration Procedures:** Methods to estimate and refine sensor calibrations using the crowdsourced data.
    * **Continuous Monitoring of Map Quality:** Metrics to assess the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the HD-map.
    * **Human-in-the-Loop Verification:** Tools and processes for human annotators and map experts to review and correct automatically generated map data.

**Workflow:**

* Participating vehicles drive in various environments, collecting sensor data.
* Data is automatically uploaded to the cloud.
* The processing pipeline automatically fuses sensor data, performs geometric reconstruction, and extracts semantic information.
* Map elements are vectorized and integrated into the HD-map database.
* The system continuously updates the map with new data and detects changes.
* Autonomous vehicles can access the HD-map for precise localization, path planning, and perception enhancement.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Scale and Management:** Handling petabytes of data requires a highly scalable and efficient infrastructure.
* **Data Quality and Consistency:** Ensuring the quality and consistency of data from a diverse fleet of vehicles is a major challenge.
* **Sensor Calibration at Scale:** Maintaining accurate sensor calibration across many vehicles is critical.
* **Automation and Efficiency:** Maximizing automation in the processing pipeline is essential to handle the volume of data.
* **Map Accuracy and Reliability:** The HD-map must be highly accurate and reliable for safe autonomous driving.
* **Privacy and Security:** Protecting the privacy of data contributors and the security of the map data is paramount.
* **Cost and Scalability of Crowdsourcing:** Incentivizing participation and scaling the system to cover large geographic areas.
* **Map Updating Frequency:** Developing mechanisms for rapid and frequent map updates to reflect changes in the real world.
